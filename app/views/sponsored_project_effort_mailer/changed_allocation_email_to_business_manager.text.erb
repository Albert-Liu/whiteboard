Hector,


Action Required: <%= @user.human_name %> just confirmed their effort for <%= Date::MONTHNAMES[@month] %> <%= @year %>,
however, the actual allocation is different than the planned allocation. 

<%= link_to  "See their allocations", "http://rails.sv.cmu.edu/sponsored_project_efforts/#{@user.twiki_name}/edit" %>

Thank you for following up on this,

Scotty Dog
