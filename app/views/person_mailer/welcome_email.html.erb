What You Need To Know About Your CMU-SV Email Address
</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Whenever you have to enter both your CMU-SV email address and password on a page with a URL ending in “google.com” (or, for server settings in an email app),
    <br/>you MUST use: <%= switch_sv_to_west(@person.email) %>
  </li>
  <li>
    BUT, we identify ourselves as "@sv.cmu.edu", and use that form everywhere else.
  </li>
</ul>
